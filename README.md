# Student Directory

The student directory script allows you to manage the list of students at the Villains Academy. Boo!
This program incorporates an interactive menu that accepts input from the user as well as the ability to read/write from/to .csv files.
It is also possible to specify which cohort of Villains Academy each participant will be on, with a default being set if none is given.

## How to use
Run the following command in the terminal from the student-directory dir.

```shell
ruby directory.rb
```
